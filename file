"I distrust a close-mouthed man.  He generally picks the wrong time to talk 
and says the wrong things.  Talking's something you can't do judiciously, 
unless you keep in practice.  Now, sir, we'll talk if you like.	I'll tell 
you right out, I'm a man who likes talking to a man who likes to talk."
-- Sidney Greenstreet, _The Maltese Falcon_
